# Figure Key
## Figure1
* A five panel figure with four smaller networks at time steps 2000, 2005, 2010, and 2015. The largest figure on the right is of the final year, 2020.
* Each panel shows species occupancy by reach at the given time step.

## Figure 2
* A three panel figure emphasizing the descrepancies between the crayfish models (solo and combo models).
* The first panel, largest on the left, shows the distribution/range of crayfish between the two models. It also has an inset plot showing the overall population growth of both models.
* The two panels, stacked on the right, show the frequency of different density bins in reaches co-occupied by smallmouth bass. These display the higher densities seen in the combined model as compared with the solo model.
